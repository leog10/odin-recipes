      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        A lemon pound cake made with yogurt instead of sour cream. I have used
        this recipe for a long time and had misplaced it. I went to my daughter
        and had her give me another copy.

        <li>1 cup butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>3 eggs, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon extract</li>
        <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>

        <li>1 (8 ounce) container lemon flavored yogurt</li>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a
          10-inch bundt pan.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer
          until light and fluffy. Beat one egg at a time into the butter
          mixture; add lemon extract with last egg.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt. Alternately mix in the
          flour mixture and the yogurt, starting and ending with the dry
          ingredients. Beat just until incorporated.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 60
          minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake
          comes out clean. Allow to cool 10 minutes in the pan, then turn out
          onto a wire rack and cool completely.
